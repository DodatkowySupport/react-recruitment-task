# ReactJS Junior Level Recruitment Task

## Task Overview

In this task, you will create a React application that fetches and displays products from an API. The goal is to evaluate your understanding of React concepts such as state management, effects, context API, and custom hooks. This task should take approximately 30 minutes.

## Project Requirements

Your task is to create a product listing page with the following features:

1. **Product Listing**:
    - Utilize the endpoint `https://fakestoreapi.com/products` to get the list of products.
    - Display the products in boxes on the frontend, showing the product image, title, and price.
2. **Category Filters**:
    - Implement category buttons that, when clicked, filter the products to show only those within the selected category.
3. **Search**:
    - Implement a search bar that filters products by title and category in a case-insensitive manner.
4. **State Management**:
    - Keep the state in the Context API.
    - Use custom hooks to manage fetching data and filtering products (optional but appreciated).
   
## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Correctness: The app functions as described and meets all requirements.
- Code Quality: The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
- Understanding of React Concepts: Proper usage of state, effects, context API, and custom hooks.
